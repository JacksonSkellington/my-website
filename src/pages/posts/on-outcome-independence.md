Back when I was a teen, my temper was **slightly** explosive. Getting heated and yelling at every minor injustice, you could say that I had a severe case of [moral righteousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteousness)(still kind of do.) in which my mildly [autistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism) brain would sound the alarms whenever somebody happens to be up to no good in my general vicinity.  

I've grown alot since then, although those alarms still sound just as loudly, I've grown accustomed to them, restraining my reflexes to set the record straight or just outright ignoring them. And those alarms were no louder than when I was coming up on the end of my senior year in highschool.

You see, I've always wanted to be Physicist, a  Matemathician or even a Computer Scientist. And so, my plan was to graduate highschool and go into college full-force persuing one of those degrees, but my family and friends had a different idea.

As it turns out, [Langrangian mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) and [Multi-variable calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus) do not put food on the table, not in this country atleast. Infact, the last time I heard of a 'Syrian nuclear scientist' is when 4 of them died in a targeted attack back in late 2014.

So, long story short, I'm a Dentist now, And all of those hours studying for a future of my choice seem to have gone to waste. Or did they?
To be honest, I'm not sure that my efforts were in vain. Obviously, I'm not sitting down and churning out solutions for toy [Number threory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) problems every other day, But, it was fun while it lasted. And that goes for most of what I spent my time learning in my life.

You can never be absolutely certain that the future you've envisioned is the one you're going to achieve. Hell, you can never be sure that when you go to sleep tonight that you'll wake up the tommorrow. You can only do what's immediately before you, and in a way, its quite comforting to let go of all could haves and should haves. Its a waste of time at best, and a brutal self-harm method at worst.

And to top it all off, I enjoy being a Dentist, the one thing I love the most in this world beside my loved ones is helping people in need. There are alot of people in this world more interested in a quick buck than to do what's right. I don't intend to butt heads with them anymore, however, I do intend on continuing to do what's right, to deliver the best medical and dental service im capable of to whoever needs it, regardless of what the outcome is.
I can only do what's immediately before me, and hope for the best.
